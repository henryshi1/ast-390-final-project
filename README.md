# AST 390 Spring 2020 - Final Project
* Stony Brook University
* Final project for course AST 390: Special Topics in Astrophysics
* Spring 2020 topic: Exoplanets
* Numerical Python simulation in Jupyter Notebook
* Using REBOUND Python package by user **hannorein**: https://github.com/hannorein/rebound
* N-body simulation of 100 Kuiper Belt objects

# Purpose
To simulate the effects of a hypothetical "Planet 9" in the Kuiper Belt on Kuiper Belt objects over 10 million years

# Programming Languages
Python, LaTeX

# File Descriptions
All Jupyter Notebooks can be found in the **code** folder. Different conditions were simulated, and their results are discussed in the final report.
